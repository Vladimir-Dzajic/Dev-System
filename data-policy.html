                    <p>Facebook uses cookies to store and further process this information, and these cookies are stored on the various devices of the visitors to the Facebook fan page, especially when the visitors are registered members of Facebook. As a result, Facebook can display targeted advertising on its own platform and also on third-party pages. Facebook does not publish in full and we do not know to what extent Facebook uses the above-mentioned data for its own purposes, to what extent activities on the Facebook fan page are associated with individual users, how long Facebook stores this data and whether data is disclosed to third parties.</p>

                    <p>We use the statistics services Facebook Insights for the purpose of designing and continually updating our pages as needed. This service records your activity on our page and sends it to us in the form of anonymised statistics. This allows us to gain an insight among other things into the activity of the visitors to our fan page, page views, the reach of contributions, views and average duration of video playbacks, information about which countries and cities our visitors come from as well as statistics on the gender balance of our visitors.</p>

                    <p>In addition, Facebook records data if you interact with our page as a registered Facebook user (e.g. if you click a Like button, send us a message, or post a comment). These interactions are also recorded and provided in the statistics by Facebook; we as the operator are unable to exert an influence on this. It is therefore not possible for us as the fan page operator to deactivate this function or to prevent data from being generated and processed.</p>

                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>In addition, we store user names and comments that are deleted on account of a breach of netiquette. These are tracked only in order to furnish any evidence that may be required in legal disputes within the period of limitation.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>The legal basis for us as the operator of the Facebook fan page to process data as mentioned above is Art. 6(1) b) GDPR (e.g. if you send us a request relating to a contract) on the one hand. On the other, the data can also be processed on the basis of your consent pursuant to Art. 6(1) a) GDPR (e.g. if you “like” or comment on one of our posts or upload content onto our page). You can withdraw the consent you have given at any time with effect for the future by deleting the comment or the content in question. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent given before it is withdrawn.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>Facebook has assumed the primary responsibility for the processing of personal data using the “Insights” service offered by Facebook. This concerns the processing of Insights data and the implementation of the rights of the data subject. Please therefore contact Facebook directly concerning all obligations arising from the GDPR in relation to the processing of Insights data. We will forward to Facebook any queries that we receive from you on this subject.</p>
