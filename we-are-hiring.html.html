        <h2>How We Hire Developers</h2>
        <p>We know applying to jobs can be stressful and we want to ease the stress by giving clear expectations up front about what to expect from our process. Read on to learn more about how we hire developers.</p>
        <h3>GUIDING PRINCIPLES</h3>
        <p><strong>Our process is fair and inclusive</strong> People from different backgrounds, with different identities and experiences, help make our products better – just as our users come from everywhere, a diverse staff helps ensure that we create products that are accessible to a wide range of people. And it all starts with Automatticians.</p>
        <p><strong>Our process is enjoyable and a learning opportunity</strong> Our second most important goal, in addition to finding great new Automatticians, is to be the best Automattic ambassadors there are. This means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>We are unfailingly kind to candidates, no matter their skill level, attitude, stage in the hiring process, or our final decision.</span></li>
            <li><span>We provide timely, clear, and honest communication and feedback to candidates, as well as access to our people for any questions and concerns.</span></li>
            <li><span>We never miss an opportunity to share the Automattic story: how we do things, what our mission is, and why it’s a great place to work.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>We give people the courtesy of a quick response</strong> We ensure transparency throughout the process and will always seek to provide quick, timely feedback and to move people through the process as efficiently as possible.</p>
        <h3>OUR HIRING PROCESS</h3>
        <p>When you apply and are selected for an interview at Automattic, it kicks off a four-part process conducted via Slack, GitHub, and P2s. It gives you (and us) a chance to see what it would be like if you worked here – and it means that by the time you’re hired, you’re familiar with how we do things and can hit the ground running.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Interview</strong> Interviews are conducted via Slack – they’re text-only. That’s how we work day-to-day, so we want to interact with you in that medium. The initial interview is a 90-minute chat (which we’ve found is the equivalent of a 60-minute face-to-face interview) with an engineer, which covers subjects like motivation, technical depth, problem solving, and managing complexity. You’ll have plenty of opportunity to ask questions, too.</li><br />
            <li><strong>Coding challenge</strong> If the interview goes well, the next stage is a take-home coding challenge with a near-real-world piece of code that closely replicates our normal work. We use it to evaluate your abilities around security, performance, and problem solving, as well as how you communicate and adapt to an unfamiliar codebase.</li><br />
            <li><strong>Trial</strong> Here’s where you really get to see what it’s like to work at Automattic. Trial projects help both of us to determine mutual compatibility and let us evaluate your work, communication, and effectiveness. This work is paid, part-time, and designed to last between two and eight weeks, for a total of around 40 hours of work. This is very flexible, and we’ll craft it to work with your schedule – both when you can start and what your availability is. If you’re able to work full-time on the project, great. If you can only work two hours on alternate Tuesdays, that’s fine, too.</li><br />
            <li><strong>Offer</strong> This is the point at which we discuss salary and start date. We can be very flexible about start dates, in order to accommodate things like notice to previous employers or time off prior to commencing employment with Automattic.</li>
